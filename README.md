Deezer is a music streaming app which has its own music recommendation system based on collaborative filtering algorithm on it s user . The main goal of this project is Devise a solution to predict whether a user listens to the first track recommended by the deezer app.So I Devised a Neural Network based solution which learns users listening history of songs based on the features provided and predicts whether that users listens to the recommended song by deezer api or not.
Our idea is to learn embeddings of users,songs,genres based on the interaction of features and output which inturn are used for prediction purpose.The only data about users was there age,gender and user_id.For genres only genre_id was provided to us.For Songs only media_id was provided  so we had to devise some way to learn something from these ids so we went for embeddings.
